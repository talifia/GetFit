##About This Work

GetFit is a single view app made for a challenge at Apple Developer Academy. This app was made specifically for my a close friend of mine who suffers from back pain and neck pain a lot due to his long work hours. This problem can happen at any time in the day, whether if he's still outside (working) or at home. He always complains how he can't find the right stretching tutorial because there is too much information on the internet and he doesn't know how to filter it.

This app is made is to help him find the best, simplest, and quickest way to stretch that can suits his condition, whether if he's outside or at home.
